## üìÑ Introduction

With extensive experience in managing complex projects and leading diverse teams across various markets, I have honed a skill set that thrives in both traditional and agile environments. This journey has fostered an open-minded, holistic approach to problem-solving and innovation.

I am enthusiastic about helping companies reimagine their processes and services, leveraging the latest technologies to drive innovation and efficiency.

Currently, I work as a Digital Transformation Specialist, following a four-year tenure in the Project Management Department at E80 Group, where I spearheaded numerous global projects. In my current role, I am at the forefront of defining our company's new digital transformation strategy.

My primary focus is on leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance knowledge management. Within this domain, I am spearheading the adoption of Generative AI, ensuring a balanced emphasis on technology, processes, and ‚Äîmost importantly‚Äî people.

With a technical background in Computer Science and certification as a PMP Project Manager, I excel at identifying and achieving strategic business objectives. I am dedicated to continuous learning and relish the opportunity to challenge and expand my expertise.
