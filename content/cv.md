## üìÑ Introduction

With a strong foundation in Project Management and years of experience leading complex, cross-functional initiatives, I specialize in guiding organizations through their digital evolution with a pragmatic yet visionary mindset.

Currently, I serve as Digital Transformation Manager at E80 Group, where I drive our corporate strategy for digital innovation. My mission is to align technology with business priorities‚Äîensuring that AI, automation, and knowledge management become powerful levers for value creation and operational excellence.

A key focus of my work is the adoption of Generative AI, not as a mere tool, but as a catalyst for transforming how knowledge is created, shared, and applied across the organization. I work at the intersection of technology, process design, and human-centric change, championing solutions that are impactful, ethical, and scalable.

Previously, I spent four years in the Project Management Department, leading global initiatives and building the multidisciplinary skills that now inform my strategic vision.

With a background in Computer Science and PMP¬Æ certification, I bring both analytical rigor and organizational sensitivity to every challenge. I thrive in environments that value curiosity, experimentation, and continuous learning, and I believe that digital transformation is ultimately a human journey.
